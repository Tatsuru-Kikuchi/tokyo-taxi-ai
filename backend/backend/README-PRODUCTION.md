## 📈 AI Features Details

### Demand Prediction Algorithm
```javascript
// Factors considered:
- Time of day (rush hours)
- Day of week (weekends)
- Weather conditions (rain +30-50%)
- Special events
- Historical patterns
```

### Revenue Forecasting
```javascript
// Predictions include:
- Next hour earnings
- Daily projections
- Best areas to position
- Surge multiplier forecasts
- Confidence scores
```

### Dynamic Pricing
```javascript
// Surge calculation based on:
- Driver availability (<3 drivers = 1.5x)
- Demand level (>80% = surge)
- Weather conditions (rain = +10%)
- Traffic congestion (heavy = +15%)
```
